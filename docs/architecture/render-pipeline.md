# Render Pipeline

The intended render path is shared by preview and export:

```text
TimelineEvaluationRequest
  -> Timeline Evaluation
  -> FlatActiveClip
  -> TimelineRenderPlan
  -> TimelineRenderPlanElement
  -> Clip Sampling / Generated Source
  -> Effect Graph Evaluation
  -> Layer Composite
  -> Color Transform
  -> Display or Export Encode
```

## Current Implementation

`mondrian-renderer::timeline_render_plan` evaluates one sequence frame through
`evaluate_timeline_render_plan(source, request)`. The request carries:

- render intent: preview, export, thumbnail, or analysis
- render quality: interactive, draft, or final
- color target: display, export, or working space
- scheduler policy: whether frame dropping is allowed
- preview/export resolution scale

The result is a `TimelineRenderPlan` with ordered `TimelineRenderPlanElement`
values plus diagnostics for active clips, emitted elements, zero-opacity skips,
and unrenderable skips.

`collect_timeline_color_diagnostics(...)` reports the clip override, working
space, and output space together with their canonical `ColorEncodingSpec`
values. Renderer diagnostics must consume `ColorSpace::encoding()` rather than
duplicating color-space metadata.

The legacy `build_timeline_render_plan` helper delegates to the evaluation API
and exists only for compatibility with code that needs the element list.

`TimelineRenderPlanElement` variants are:

- `Media`
- `Adjustment`
- `SolidColor`
- `NestedSequence`

Each element carries opacity, blend mode, transforms where applicable, effect graph, frame seed, and color/media interpretation data.

`timeline_composite` still supports CPU RGBA compositing and a float-linear path for simple normal-blend media. `FrameCompositor` supports GPU batched compositing with texture pooling and can return either RGBA readback or a GPU texture.

## Required Semantics

- Disabled clips and zero-opacity clips do not enter the render plan.
- Clip blend mode overrides track blend mode; otherwise track blend mode applies.
- Adjustment layers operate on lower accumulated pixels, not as standalone media.
- Solid colors are generated sources, not file-backed frames.
- Nested sequences must preserve the configured nested color-processing mode.
- Effect graphs are compiled from clip effects plus masks at the evaluated time.

## Preview vs Export

Preview and export may use different scheduling, cache lifetime, and readback strategy. They must share timeline interpretation, clip ordering, effect evaluation, blend semantics, and color-management decisions.

Preview callers must use `TimelineEvaluationRequest::preview(...)`. Export
callers must use `TimelineEvaluationRequest::export(...)`. Any future thumbnail,
analysis, AI, or cache-warm path should add an explicit intent instead of
reinterpreting sequence state directly.

The renderer test suite contains an explicit preview/export semantic-signature
contract. It allows request settings such as intent, quality, color target, frame
drop policy, and resolution scale to differ, but requires media source timing,
nested-sequence source timing, element order, blend/opacity, transforms, clip
interpretation, and nested color-processing mode to remain identical for the
same sequence frame.
