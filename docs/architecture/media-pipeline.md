# Media Pipeline

`mondrian-media` owns FFmpeg-based media inspection, decode support, waveform/proxy/cache primitives, and audio buffers.

## Probe

`MediaInfo::probe(path)` uses FFmpeg format/codec metadata without decoding full media. It extracts:

- container and duration
- file size
- video streams: codec, dimensions, frame rate, pixel format, bit depth, alpha, detected color space, structured color interpretation, frame count
- audio streams: codec, sample rate, channels, layout, bit depth

The probe runs off the UI thread.

## Decode and Cache

Decoding and frame caching belong to media/renderer/export paths, not UI widgets. UI panels may request thumbnails or waveform data through app adapters, but must not own FFmpeg state.

## Asset Classification

`mondrian-assets` classifies imported files using `MediaInfo`. Audio-only extensions or media without meaningful video streams become `Audio`; media with video becomes `Video`.

Synthetic assets use `MediaInfo::synthetic_adjustment_layer()` and `MediaInfo::synthetic_solid_color()`.

## Color Metadata

Media probe separates detected metadata from policy assumptions.
`VideoStreamInfo.detected_color_space` is the transform-facing detected-only
index. `VideoStreamInfo.color_interpretation` is the diagnostic/UI-facing
interpretation with confidence, evidence, warnings, and a user-overridable flag.
Evidence records whether a result came from a camera/log metadata hint, exact
CICP tags, partial CICP tags, unsupported CICP tags, or decoder unavailability.
Clip-level `MediaInterpretation` can override color space, frame rate, pixel aspect ratio, field order, and alpha interpretation.

Asset library records store persistent user intent separately as
`AssetMediaInterpretation`. Imported media defaults to `Auto`; Auto means "resolve
from current metadata, detector, and project color policy" and must not persist
the currently resolved color space. User changes from the asset-library
Interpret Footage dialog are stored as `Override { color_space }` or `Data` and
must remain stable across metadata re-probes, relinks, and detector upgrades.
UI may display the current resolved result beside Auto, but that resolved value
comes from probe/color-management diagnostics rather than the asset record.
Preview and export resolve input color with the same precedence: clip-level
override, then asset-library interpretation, then detected metadata, then the
sequence missing-metadata policy.

Unknown/missing metadata policy is resolved at sequence color-management time, not by UI panels.
