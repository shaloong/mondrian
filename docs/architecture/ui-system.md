# UI System

Mondrian's UI is self-hosted: winit/platform integration, retained widgets, wgpu rendering, theme tokens, event routing, dock/layout, and app panel adapters.

## Crate Split

- `mondrian-ui-core`: widget trait, event types, accessibility, focus/shortcut/tooltip traits, tree traversal.
- `mondrian-ui-theme`: semantic tokens and theme preference.
- `mondrian-ui-layout`: reusable layout algorithms.
- `mondrian-ui-renderer`: draw-command renderer over wgpu.
- `mondrian-ui-text`: text layout/raster support.
- `mondrian-ui-events`: event routing, focus/capture/shortcut/IME/DnD side effects.
- `mondrian-ui-tooltip`: tooltip manager/widget.
- `mondrian-ui-widgets`: controls and editor-specific reusable surfaces.
- `mondrian-app::app_ui`: product shell and panel adapters.

## Widget Contract

`Widget` is retained-mode and exposes:

- `measure`
- `layout`
- `event`
- `paint`
- optional overlay paint/hit-test
- children traversal
- focus/accessibility metadata

`paint()` must be side-effect free. `event()` may request platform side effects through `EventRequests`; app/platform layers execute them.

## Focus and Accessibility

Focus ownership is not the same as visible focus indication. `FocusSource::Keyboard` may show a focus ring; pointer/programmatic focus owns keyboard input but normally does not show the ring.

Accessibility `focused` must reflect real focus ownership, not `focus_visible`.

## Overlay and Menus

Dropdowns, context menus, popovers, and tooltips should render through overlay paint/hit-test so they are not clipped or hidden behind sibling panels. Menubar menus and context menus should share menu primitives.

## Commands

Menus, shortcut preferences, command palette, and future plugins should consume `app_ui::commands` descriptors. Menus are command presentation, not business logic owners.

## Playback Tick Ownership

The winit host may wake the application while playback is running, but playback
state transitions belong to `AppState`. Window code passes elapsed time into
`AppState::advance_playback_clock(...)` and only reacts to the returned refresh
contract.

Playback frame advancement must:

- keep sub-frame elapsed time in an app-owned accumulator
- use the configured clock role for frame targeting
- pause on the last content frame and mark natural end-of-playback separately
  from user pause/seek
- expose a bounded next-frame wakeup delay so the UI loop does not busy-poll

Viewer preview rendering remains an adapter concern. It consumes the current
playback frame from `AppState`; it must not own playback state or mutate the
timeline to request frames.

## Viewer Preview Scheduling

Playback-frame refreshes use a narrow UI update path: the host advances
`AppState`, then refreshes viewer playback chrome/frame data and the timeline
playhead without rebuilding the full dock tree.

`AppUiPreviewService` owns media preview scheduling. Each viewer preview request
starts a monotonic generation, and background media jobs check that their key is
still requested by the latest generation before decoding. Completed stale jobs
may warm the cache, but they do not force a UI refresh for an older playback
frame.

Media preview frames are held in a bounded LRU cache keyed by asset identity,
file modification stamp, source frame/time, and target preview dimensions.
Playback requests may enqueue a small forward prefetch window, but prefetching is
best-effort: it must not rebuild UI state, block the current frame, or bypass the
generation checks that protect continuous playback from stale decode work.
