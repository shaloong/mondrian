# UI System

Mondrian's UI is self-hosted: winit/platform integration, retained widgets, wgpu rendering, theme tokens, event routing, dock/layout, and app panel adapters.

## Crate Split

- `mondrian-ui-core`: widget trait, event types, accessibility, focus/shortcut/tooltip traits, tree traversal.
- `mondrian-ui-theme`: semantic tokens and theme preference.
- `mondrian-ui-layout`: reusable layout algorithms.
- `mondrian-ui-renderer`: draw-command renderer over wgpu.
- `mondrian-ui-text`: text layout/raster support.
- `mondrian-ui-events`: event routing, focus/capture/shortcut/IME/DnD side effects.
- `mondrian-ui-tooltip`: tooltip manager/widget.
- `mondrian-ui-widgets`: controls and editor-specific reusable surfaces.
- `mondrian-app::app_ui`: product shell and panel adapters.

## Widget Contract

`Widget` is retained-mode and exposes:

- `measure`
- `layout`
- `event`
- `paint`
- optional overlay paint/hit-test
- children traversal
- focus/accessibility metadata

`paint()` must be side-effect free. `event()` may request platform side effects through `EventRequests`; app/platform layers execute them.

## Focus and Accessibility

Focus ownership is not the same as visible focus indication. `FocusSource::Keyboard` may show a focus ring; pointer/programmatic focus owns keyboard input but normally does not show the ring.

Accessibility `focused` must reflect real focus ownership, not `focus_visible`.

## Overlay and Menus

Dropdowns, context menus, popovers, and tooltips should render through overlay paint/hit-test so they are not clipped or hidden behind sibling panels. Menubar menus and context menus should share menu primitives.

## Commands

Menus, shortcut preferences, command palette, and future plugins should consume `app_ui::commands` descriptors. Menus are command presentation, not business logic owners.
